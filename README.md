<summary><b>Task 1: </b> Installing all essential tools and compiling a 'C' code using gcc compiler.</summary>
<br>
1. A program, which counts from 1 to 'n' numbers, was coded in C language and was run using gcc compiler.

The code is as follows:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, sum = 0, n = 60;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of number from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

  The output was run using ./a.out

<summary><b>Task 2: </b>SPIKE Simulation.</summary> 

The instruction set (Object Dump) is given below.

![Task2 instruction set](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a475392-69c3-498b-b270-47286a60c10c)

1. The 'C' program code (Sum of 1 to n numbers) was run using riscv architecture using a spike simulator and output was obtained.

   ![Task2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318835d9-7191-4084-ac8d-b16bca51c9a9)

2. The object dump of the riscv architecture was opened and debugging was done using spike.
3. The program counter (pc) was run till a certain instruction and it was manually run after that for debugging. 
   Each instruction was run by clicking enter each time.

   ![Task2 2 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/883e2368-142c-4c9e-9c80-d22d2ffd627d)

4. The contents of the Stack Pointer(SP) register was observed. The stack pointer register(SP) instruction was run and the contents of the SP were looked at again.
