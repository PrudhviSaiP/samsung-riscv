## VSLI-Internship   

### INTRODUCTION
The VSDSquadron Mini Internship is a dynamic, short-term program designed to offer hands-on experience in VLSI design, semiconductor technology, and related fields. It serves as a bridge between academic learning and industry-ready skills.
During my internship at Samsung-VSD, I had the opportunity to explore and work with the CH32V003F4U6, a 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller. The VSD Squadron Mini is widely recognized for its contributions to open-source EDA tools, RISC-V development, and embedded systems.
I worked with the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Kit, a robust platform built on the RISC-V architecture. This project provided an opportunity to delve into embedded systems and explore how RISC-V integrates into various development workflows. I gained practical, hands-on experience with its core features while applying cutting-edge techniques in embedded system design.

<summary><b>Task 3: </b>Understanding and identifying different instruction types (R, I, S, B, U, J).</summary> 
<br>

## Instructions:
Instructions are a set of machine language instructions that a particular processor understands and executes. A processor performs tasks on the basis of the instruction provided.
An instruction comprises of groups called fields. These fields include:
* The Operation code (Opcode) field which specifies the operation to be performed.
* The Address field which contains the location of the operand, i.e., register or memory location.
* The Mode field which specifies how the operand will be located.

  
The RISC-V instructions are categorized into **6** types based on their field organization. The types include:
- **R-type**: Register type
- **I-type**: Immediate type
- **S-type**: Store type
- **B-type**: Branch type
- **U-type**: Upper immediate type
- **J-type**: Jump type

Lets discuss one by one:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. R-Type Instruction:

![R type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aefa71e-76ba-43c5-9e8c-b5dbb54559b4)

R-type instructions are one of the six types of instructions in RISC-V's RV32I instruction set.
It is a register-register instruction that uses registers for both the source and destination.
R-type instructions are used for arithmetic and logic operations.
It specifies the two operands and the destination of the result using register file locations.
The R-type instruction has multiple fields, including: 
* The opcode field : Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The destination register operand (rd): The register which stores the result of the operation.
* Source register operands (rs1, rs2): The registers where the input is stored.
* 'funct3' field: It is the field after the destination register . This field is 3 – bit length     i.e. from bit 12 to bit 14 and it further tells about the operation, such as whether it is an     addition, subtraction, or a logical operation that is being performed.
* 'funct7' field: It is the last field of R -type instruction format . It describes the              operation, such as whether it is a shift or multiplication operation etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. I-Type Instruction:

![I type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13229840-4f30-4c08-95e7-5b9096e90193)

An I-type instruction in RISC-V is an instruction that uses a 12-bit constant as one of its operands. This constant is also known as an immediate. I-type instructions are also known as Immediate instructions. The 12-bit constant is a signed 2's complement number that is sign extended to form a 32-bit operand. I-type instructions perform the same operations as R-type instructions, but use an immediate value instead of an rs2 index. I-type instructions can be used for loads, stores, branches, or immediate ALU operations. The immediate field in an I-type instruction holds an immediate value that can be interpreted as an unsigned integer or two's complement. 
The I-type instruction also has multiple fields, including: 
* Immediate field (20 to 31): The immediate field is a part of an instruction that holds a constant value. The immediate field is used for arithmetic operations.
* The opcode field : Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The destination register operand (rd): The register which stores the result of the operation.
* 'funct3' field: It is the field after the destination register . This field is 3 – bit length     i.e. from bit 12 to bit 14 and it further tells about the operation, such as whether it is an     addition, subtraction, or a logical operation that is being performed.
* Source register operand (rs1): The register where one of the input is stored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. S-Type Instruction:

![s type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e345a066-5997-485a-bfbb-2f036df1fa5d)

S-type instructions are used to store data from registers into memory. The S-type instruction format is used exclusively for memory store instructions. The immediate value in S-type instructions is split up into different bits.
The multiple fields in a S-Type instruction are:
* The opcode field : Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* Immediate fields (One from 7 to 11 and another from 25 to 31): The immediate field in an S-type instruction is used to store the contents of a register to data memory.
* 'funct3' field: It is the field after the destination register . This field is 3 – bit length     i.e. from bit 12 to bit 14 and it further tells about the operation, such as whether it is an     addition, subtraction, or a logical operation that is being performed.
* Source register operands (rs1, rs2): The registers where the input is stored.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. B-Type Instruction:

![B type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02a0ca26-53f3-4747-9112-baf0a155da6d)

A B-type instruction in RISC-V is a branch instruction that controls the flow of a program. It compares two values in registers and branches to a new address. B-type instructions are a variation of S-type instructions.  B-type instructions are used for conditional branches, which test two registers and branch if the test passes. The target address for a B-type instruction is calculated by adding a branch offset to the current program counter (PC) value. The branch offset is stored as an immediate in the instruction. The fields in the B-Type instruction are:
* The opcode field : Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The immediate field: The immediate field in a B-type instruction in RISC-V is a 12-bit field that stores a branch offset. The branch offset is used to calculate the target address for an instruction.
* 'funct3' field: It is the field after the immediate field. This field is 3 – bit length i.e. from bit 12 to bit 14 and it further tells about the operation, such as whether it is an addition, subtraction, or a logical operation that is being performed.
* Source register operands (rs1, rs2): The registers where the input is stored.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. U-Type Instruction:

![u type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3825ff30-62a1-4c58-92d3-1bcfe92e7375)

A U-type instruction in RISC-V is a type of instruction that specifies the upper 20 bits of a register's immediate value. It's also known as an "Upper immediate" instruction. The U-type instruction loads a 20-bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of a register. The instruction only requires the destination register index (rd) and the 20-bit immediate number. The immediate number can be used directly as an operand. U-type instructions are used for special data manipulation instructions. They can be used to form addresses within a register. The fields in the U-Type instruction are:
* The opcode field (0 to 6): Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The destination register operand (rd) (7 to 11): The register index which stores the result of the operation.
* The immediate field (12 to 31) : The immediate field in a U-type instruction in RISC-V is a 20-bit value that specifies the upper 20 bits of a register.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. J-Type Instruction:

![J- Type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b5b80b9-2c25-48db-93ff-3365f1b44d4e)

A J-type instruction in RISC-V is a jump instruction that unconditionally transfers control to a new instruction address. They use all of the non-opcode space for a 26-bit jump destination field. J-type instructions are part of the PC updating instructions, along with B-type instructions.
* The opcode field (0 to 6): Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The destination register operand (rd) (7 to 11): The register index which stores the result of the operation.
* The immediate fields (12 to 31) : The immediate field in J type is is a 20-bit value that specifies the upper 20 bits of a register, similar to U type but it is slightly different.

<summary><b>Task 4: </b>Functional Simulation using GTKWave.</summary> 
<br>
    

### ABOUT IVERILOG AND GTKWAWE 

 ***Icarus Verilog*** (Iverilog) and ***GTKWave*** are widely used open-source tools for Verilog-based digital design and simulation. Iverilog functions as a Verilog simulator, enabling users to compile and execute simulations of their Verilog code, including modules and testbenches. It produces simulation output in formats such as VCD (Value Change Dump), which can be viewed using GTKWave. GTKWave is a waveform viewer that presents simulation results in a graphical format, allowing users to analyze signal transitions, zoom into specific events, and debug their designs effectively. Together, these tools create a comprehensive simulation and verification setup, with Iverilog handling simulation and GTKWave facilitating result interpretation.

###### INSTALLATION STEPS  


###### (1)  Installing:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iverilog gtkwave
```
###### (2) Generating files:
```
MAKE TWO FILES IN .v FORMAT AS SAID EARLIER FOR VERILOG NETLIST AND FOR THE TESTBENCH


```


###### (3) Compiling the iverilog:
```
iverilog -o my_simulation.vvp sv.v sbt.v
```
###### (4) To run the simulation:
```
vvp my_simulation.vvp

```
###### Waveform Using GTKWave:
```
gtkwave iiitb_rv32i.vcd
```

##### [it will give the simulation] 
###### [ if the vcd file is not found to be in directory then give commant : "ls -1" and see the .vcd file in the directory and run the command for GTKwave]

#### ABOUT PIPELINE
###### This is typical 5-stage RISC pipeline, which consists of the following stages:

###### Instruction Fetch (IF): Signals: IF_ID_IR, IF_ID_NPC Instruction is fetched from memory and the next program counter (NPC) is calculated.
  
###### Instruction Decode (ID): Signals: ID_EX_A, ID_EX_B, ID_EX_IMMEDIATE, ID_EX_IR  .The fetched instruction is decoded, and the register values are read.

###### Execute (EX): Signals: EX_MEM_ALUOUT, EX_MEM_IR .The instruction is processed, and ALU operations are performed.
###### Memory Access (MEM): Signals: MEM_WB_ALUOUT, MEM_WB_LDM .Memory operations like loads and stores are performed.
###### Write Back (WB): Signals: WB_OUT .Results from the ALU or memory are written back to the register file.

# Overview

#### The Smart Light Sensor is an intelligent lighting system that automates lighting control based on ambient light levels and motion detection. It utilizes an LDR to measure brightness and a PIR sensor for motion detection, running on the VSDSquadron Mini (CH32V003F4U6) microcontroller. This project enhances energy efficiency by ensuring lights are only active when needed and reduces the manual intervention of turning the light on or off.

***
## Components Required To Build a Light Sensor:

* VSD SQUADRON MINI (CH32V003F4U6 chip with 32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set)
* 3 LDR's
* LED / Light source
* PIR Sensor
* Optional: Relay or MOSFET for controlling external lights

* Bread Board
* Jumper Wires

## Table for Pin connection:


| CH32V003x Pins  | Peripherals |
|--------------|--------------|
| 5 volts      |  VCC For all Devices   |
| GND          | Ground For all Devices   |
|  PD5         | Ldr 1       |
|  PD4         | Ldr 2  |
|  PD3    |   Ldr 3  |
|  PD6    |   In built-Led   |
|  PD2    |   Output LED/ Light source  |
|  PC4    |   PIR Sensor input  |

## WORKING OF THE  CODE

The code checks the output of the PIR sensor (HIGH/LOW) and if the output is HIGH, it will check the ambient brightness using LDR's and accordingly light the LED (or any light) for optimum use. If there is enough brightness in the surroundings, the LED is turned off. If the PIR sensor's output is LOW then the LED is turned off for power saving.

## PROGRAMME CODE
```

    pinMode(pir, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
    bool pir_val = digitalRead(pir);
    if (pir_val == HIGH){
      digitalWrite(ledpin2, HIGH);
    }
    else if (pir_val == LOW){

    }
    bool ldr1 = digitalRead(ldrpin1);
    bool ldr2 = digitalRead(ldrpin2);
    bool ldr3 = digitalRead(ldrpin3);
    
    if (pir_val == HIGH){
      if (ldr1 == LOW && ldr2 == LOW && ldr3 == LOW){
        setPWMDuty(10000);
      }
      else if (ldr1 == HIGH && ldr2 == LOW && ldr3 == LOW){
        setPWMDuty(1000);
      }
      else if (ldr1 == HIGH && ldr2 == HIGH && ldr3 == LOW) {

      }
      else if (ldr1 == HIGH && ldr2 == HIGH && ldr3 == HIGH) {
        setPWMDuty(0);
      }
    }
    else {
      setPWMDuty(0);
    }
    
}
void setPWMDuty(int pulseWidth) {  
  if (pulseWidth == 0){
      digitalWrite(ledpin, LOW);
  }

  else{
    for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    
      digitalWrite(ledpin, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(pulseWidth);
      digitalWrite(ledpin, LOW);
      delay(20 - (pulseWidth / 1000)); 
    }
  }
}
